## Reflection
It has been helpful for me to learn the fundamentals of Figma. I now know how to use grids, auto layout, the pen tool, and distinguish between grids and constraints. Just like a digital pencil, the pen tool is excellent for sketching exact forms. Because auto layout arranges pieces automatically, it saves me a tonne of time. Grids help me keep my designs tidy and orderly. Being aware of limitations enables my elements to adapt to various screen sizes. For me, designing has been simpler, quicker, and more collaborative after I mastered these fundamentals. It's also improved my capacity to be creative and make amazing digital experiences.
